# KAAD
An Adaptive Learning Dashboard

Me and my colleagues wanted to create an innovative Learning Dashboard like Coursera/LinkedIn Learning, but with more features such as-
1. tracking students' progress in their respective courses
2.  suggesting improvements in their learning patterns or course recommendations
3. a Forums page, where students from among all the universities could discuss courses and topics of similar interests

This was possible by tracking user metrics in real time and suggesting adaptive feedbacks to the students, which could improve their learning outcomes.

In this project, my main role was of Frontend UI/UX design along with a colleague, and some contributions in Backend Development

P.S. KAAD is the abbreviation of each of our group's members' first initial ;)
